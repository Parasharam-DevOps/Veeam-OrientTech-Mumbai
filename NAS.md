# What is NAS ?


A NAS system is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a centralized location for authorized network users and heterogeneous clients. NAS systems are flexible and scale-out, meaning that as you need additional storage, you can add on to what you have. NAS is like having a private cloud in the office. It’s faster, less expensive and provides all the benefits of a public cloud on site, giving you complete control.

**NAS systems are perfect for Small Buisnesses.**

* Simple to operate, a dedicated IT professional is often not required
* Lower cost
* Easy data backup, so it’s always accessible when you need it
* Good at centralizing data storage in a safe, reliable way
* With a NAS system, data is continually accessible, making it easy for employees to collaborate, respond to customers in a timely fashion, and promptly follow up on sales or other issues because information is in one place. Because NAS is like a private cloud, data may be accessed remotely using a network connection, meaning employees can work anywhere, anytime.
